Development System
==================

    This code was developed on a 486 DX/33 with himem.sys version 3.09 of the
extended memory manager.  The code has also been tested within Windows 3.1,
which emulates version 2.0 of XMS in a DOS box.  The code was written with
Borland C++ 4.0, compiled under the large memory model.


Frequently (and Infrequently) Asked Questions
=============================================

What is XMMLIB?
---------------

    XMMLIB is a set of functions that provide a simple API to the eXtended
Memory Specification (XMS) functions, as described in XMS 2.0, copyright 1988,
Microsoft Corporation, Lotus Development Corporation, Intel Corporation, and
AST Research, Inc.

Okay, what is XMS?
------------------

    XMS gives you the ability to access memory outside the conventional 640K
imposed by DOS.  This includes Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs), memory between 640K
and 1024K;  the High Memory Area (HMA), memory between 1024K and 1088K;  and
Extended Memory Blocks (EMBs), memory above 1088K.

Why do I need this?
-------------------

    Because if you try to write a standard DOS program, it can't access more
than 640K, even if you have oodles and oodles of memory in your machine.  DOS
just won't let you.

Why is DOS so stupid?
---------------------

    I don't know.  When the PC was originally introduced, a machine that came
with 64K was really hot stuff.  So the designers said, okay, let's let this
machine have a whole lot of memory, like, say, 640K!  This means it'll take
2.5 bytes to address it all, and we'll say that video drivers and stuff will
exist between 640K and 1024K.  But 2.5 bytes of addressing is pretty weird, so
let's say it's normally two bytes (called near addressing) within a segment, so
that a segment can have 64K.  We'll call the address within the segment the
offset.  And then let's use another two bytes for the segment address to
address within 1024K, allowing segments to overlap.  That means the real
address is the segment address shifted left four bits, plus the offset address.
Pretty hokey, eh?
    But that was a long time ago.  Today, you can do 32-bit protected mode
programming, which is available on only 386 machines and above.

Okay, then why don't you just do 32-bit protected mode programming?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, you can.  But I won't.

Why?
----

    Because I'm afraid of it.  You can learn how to from someone else, but
right here, you've got the XMS.

Wait!  You forgot EMS!
----------------------

    Oh, that.  (Groan.)  Okay, the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) also
gives you the same capabilities as XMS, but the structure is different.  In
EMS, you map the physical expanded memory into small 16K windows somewhere in
upper memory.  So you kind of move your window around to look at all of the
physical memory.  The problem with this is that you must use precious upper
memory to do this, and upper memory is where you usually load drivers (unless
it's full, in which case you'd be stuck stuffing them in conventional memory).
And the API to EMS uses interrupt calls, which can be kind of slow.

Okay, then I'm stuck with XMS for now.
--------------------------------------

    Yup.

So... how do I use it?
----------------------

    Do you know how to program in C++?

Sure.
-----

    When you write your next "big" program that requires extended memory, just
include the "xmmlib.h" header file and the "xmmlib.obj" object file.  All of
the functions you need are prototyped in the header file.  I'd suggest using
the large memory model, because all pointers become far pointers, and, in fact,
the object code is compiled for that memory model.  If you choose to use a
different memory model, recompile "xmmlib.cpp" and link "xmmlib.obj" into your
program.
    You probably need only use the basic functions, like XMM_Initialize(),
XMM_AllocateBlock(), XMM_FreeBlock(), and XMM_memcpy(), which mimics regular
_fmemcpy(), only with extended memory.

Wait a minute...  How about the HMA, UMBs, and A20 line stuff?
--------------------------------------------------------------

    Sorry, I only implemented the EMB portion of the XMS.  I figured that if I
could access EMBs, that'd be all I need.  Besides, EMBs consist of all memory
above 1088K, while the HMA is only 64K and the UMBs are only 384K at most.  The
A20 line is the 21st addressing line used to access the HMA.  If you don't know
what it is or how to use it, don't.

So... can I include your source code?
-------------------------------------

    Sure, I don't care.  I know how frustrating it is to use a library without
being able to see the source code, so I've included it here.  Just give me
some credit (no money) if you decide to use this.

All right...  can I... change your code too?  I don't like some of it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'll admit I'm not a perfect programmer, so sure, I don't care.  I know how
frustrating it is to use a library without being able to change the source
code, so I'm giving you permission to do so.  As long you give me some credit,
I'll be happy.

I can use your code, I can alter it... for free?  What's the catch?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    No catch.  This is freeware.  Use it as you wish.  Just give me some credit
for the code that you do use, and if you distribute this archive, please
include all the files, unaltered.

Why did you write XMMLIB?
-------------------------

    I wrote XMMLIB because I needed to access more memory than the pathetic
640K upper limit that DOS currently imposes.  I'm writing a game, and I can't
seem to fit all the sprites that I need in memory (these are big sprites).
    Actually, the truth is, I wrote XMMLIB because I received the XMS in the
mail from Microsoft before I got the EMS from Intel.  If you want a copy of the
XMS (free of charge), call Microsoft Customer Support.  Or, if you're a
masochist and want the EMS (free of charge), call Intel Customer Support.

Why is this freeware?
---------------------

    Because I don't need your money.  Besides, I doubt that anything that I
write would be commercially successful.

What is your favorite color?
-----------------------------

    I kind of like Teal-Gray, but I'll settle for California Navy Blue and
Gold.

Do you sleep with sheep?
------------------------

    Why, is your mother available?

What do you do for a living?
----------------------------

    I work.  I'm a programmer, working for an undisclosed firm.

Mother, may I?
--------------

    Ask your father, damn it!

How do I get in contact with you?
---------------------------------

    You can e-mail me at:  chang@alumni.eecs.berkeley.edu (Yes, I'm a Cal grad)
or paulibus@rahul.net (my internet service provider).
    You can send all comments, suggestions, fan mail, and death threats to the
above addresses.  If you don't have internet access, well, tough beans.
